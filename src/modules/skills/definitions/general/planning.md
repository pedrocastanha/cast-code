# Planning

Capability to plan and decompose complex tasks.

## Planning Process

### 1. Understand the Goal
- What is the end result?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the success criteria?

### 2. Gather Context
- Read relevant existing code
- Understand current architecture
- Identify dependencies

### 3. Decompose
- Break into independent steps
- Order by dependencies
- Identify parallel work

### 4. Estimate Complexity
- Simple: single file, few lines
- Medium: multiple files, clear pattern
- Complex: architectural changes, new patterns

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

### Good Tasks
- Specific and measurable
- Independent when possible
- Testable
- Appropriately sized

### Task Template
1. What: Clear description
2. Where: Files to modify
3. How: Approach summary
4. Verify: How to test

## Risk Assessment
- Identify what could go wrong
- Plan for edge cases
- Consider rollback strategy
